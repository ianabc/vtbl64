# rd133

This is another copy of Will Kranz's code for working with IOMega Backups.

There are a number of win32 console programs on Will's site along which can be
used to examine the Image.113 archives generated by IOMega backup.

## Archive Structure

This README deals only with the archive I was asked to extract; a 3.2GB
compressed .113 file. For more information on other formats, please see [Will's
site](http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm).

0x7400 == 29696 == 32K - 3K 

As far as I can tell (QIC-113 Rev. G p39) the 3K is "reserved for an error
correction code (ECC)". On the same page, the also say that the frame size is actually

  32K - ECC - 2 - "frame offset"

They explicitly list frame offset as 2.

"Compression Frames may be concatenated together to fill a segment. However if a
frame ends within the last 18 bytes of available space in a segment (after
accounting for ECC), these remaining bytes are to be null flled and remain
unused. If a given frame has a Frame size that leaves more than 18 bytes
available, another frame is expected to immediately follow

### Headers
The file has two headers in the first two segments of the file (each segment is
an 0x7400 block). It corresponds to
